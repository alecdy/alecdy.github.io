This is my site hosted on Github Pages.  The theme I used is called "Millenial" by Paul Le.  Please check it out below.

## Millenial Theme
Millennial is a minimalist Jekyll theme for running a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for your publication site or blog through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or on your own server. Everything that you will ever need to know about this Jekyll theme is included in the README below, which you can also find in [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/).
